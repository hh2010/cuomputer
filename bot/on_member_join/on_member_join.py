@client.event
async def on_member_join(member):
    """
    Handles new members joining the Discord server.
    
    This function is triggered when a user joins the server. It performs several important tasks:
    
    1. Discord-Weezify Connection Flow (Step 1):
       - Assigns the "Visitor" role to new members
       - Sends a welcome message in the welcome channel
       - DMs the user with instructions and their Discord snowflake ID
    
    The Discord snowflake ID is critical for users to connect their Discord account to Weezify.
    Users will need this ID to enter on their Weezify profile at https://www.weezify.web.app.
    
    Connection Process Overview:
    1. THIS FUNCTION: User joins server, gets DM with snowflake ID
    2. User enters snowflake ID on Weezify profile page
    3. User goes to #connect-to-mrn channel and types their Weezify username
    4. Bot confirms connection (handled by connect_to_mrn function)
    
    Known Issues:
    - Users with restrictive DM privacy settings won't receive the welcome DM
      Solution: They need to temporarily enable "Allow direct messages from server members"
      or get their snowflake ID through other means
    
    Parameters:
    member (Member): The Discord member object representing the user who joined
    
    Returns:
    None
